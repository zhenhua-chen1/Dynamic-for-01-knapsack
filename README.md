# An Algorithm Based on Dynamic Programming to Solve the 0-1 Knapsack Problem
## input:
weight=[2,2,6,5,4];%the weight of something;<br>
value=[6,3,5,4,6];%the value of something.<br>

## Process:
Dynamic Programming(cost is the transposed matrix)

## output:
value_choose;% Choose which one into the knapsack.
